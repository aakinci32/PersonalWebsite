            <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Arda Akinci</strong> and I'm an second year 
            student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie
    Mellon University.I excelled my first year achieving a 4.0 GPA, along with 
            being on the Dean's List twice! I have a background in hardware 
            research and an interest in software, as well. I'm looking to 
            expand my experience and explore further avenues. </p>

            <strong>March Madness Simulator</strong>
            <p>I designed and coded entire project in Python. I implemented AI and 
            real life ball physics and animations to strengthen user interface
            It contains two settings: tournament simulation, and free throw practice
            It was final project for programming class in which we were tasked to 
            complete in 2.5 weeks</p>

            <strong>Weather React.js Application</strong>
            <p>I created an app using React.js, HTML, CSS that displays the 
                weather forecast and time at a city. I used Axios to request 
                data from a weather API</p>

            <strong>NFL Game Generator</strong>
            <p>I developed a web-scraping algorithm that crawls NFL websites 
                for game data. The app displays score, data, and all players 
                played in given game</p>

            <strong>Research Intern, Carnegie Mellon University Department of 
                Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>
            <p>I analyzed the technology in Intel Optane SSD and its efficiency 
                relative to competitive SSDs and HDD. I deconstructed parts and 
                created circuits to measure SSDs power consumption 
                I tested using various softwares such as Iometer and CrystalDiskMark. 
                I also constructed and built my own power consumption testing</p> 
                <br>
                <strong>Peer Tutor, Carnegie Mellon University</strong>
                <p>I tutored 15-112 (Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science
                    and 18-100 (Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering)
                    to students in need of help. I spent 5-10 hours/week</p>
                <br>
            <strong>Intern - LeanFM Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA</strong>
            <p>I analyzed diagrams of buildings and HVAC sensor data and mapped
                 sensor data to what was specified on the drawings</p>
